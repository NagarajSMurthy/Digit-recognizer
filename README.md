# Digit-recognizer-
Digit recognition is a simple task of recognising digits from 0 to 9. A simple CNN is trained on the MNIST dataset which gave a good accuracy of around 98% on the test set. Choosing the proper model and employing suitable regularisation technique, the model also performed well during inference with an accuracy of close to 98%. The whole model is then converted to ONNX format and run on CPU with ONNX Runtime.
